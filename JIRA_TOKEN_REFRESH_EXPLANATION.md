# 🔄 Jira Token Refresh Implementation

## **❌ The Problem: Jira OAuth 2.0 Doesn't Support Refresh Tokens**

### **What We Discovered:**
- **Jira OAuth 2.0 does NOT provide refresh tokens**
- Traditional OAuth refresh flow doesn't work with Jira
- Access tokens expire after 1 hour and cannot be automatically refreshed
- The system was failing because it was trying to use non-existent refresh tokens

### **Evidence from Terminal Logs:**
```
❌ Token refresh failed: {"error":"unauthorized_client","error_description":"refresh_token is invalid"}
```

## **✅ The Solution: Re-Authentication Flow**

### **How It Works Now:**

1. **Token Expiry Detection**: System detects when tokens are about to expire
2. **Re-Authentication Required**: Instead of refresh, user must re-authenticate
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear messaging about re-authentication needs
4. **Automatic Deactivation**: Failed integrations are marked as inactive

### **Updated Implementation:**

#### **1. Auth Service Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD: Tried to use refresh tokens (doesn't work)
refreshToken: tokenData.refresh_token

// NEW: Acknowledges no refresh tokens
refreshToken: null // Jira OAuth 2.0 doesn't provide refresh tokens
```

#### **2. Refresh Method:**
```javascript
async refreshAccessToken(integrationId) {
  console.log(`⚠️  Jira OAuth 2.0 doesn't support refresh tokens`);
  console.log(`🔄 Integration ${integrationId} needs re-authentication`);
  
  // Mark integration as needing re-authentication
  await db.run(`
    UPDATE integrations 
    SET is_active = 0, refresh_failures = refresh_failures + 1, last_refresh_at = ?
    WHERE id = ?
  `, [new Date().toISOString(), integrationId]);

  throw new Error('Token refresh not supported by Jira OAuth 2.0 - re-authentication required');
}
```

#### **3. Frontend Handling:**
```javascript
if (data.requiresReauth) {
  const reauth = confirm(`⚠️ Jira OAuth 2.0 doesn't support token refresh.\n\nIntegration ${id} needs re-authentication.\n\nWould you like to start a new OAuth flow?`);
  if (reauth) {
    startAuth();
  }
}
```

## **🎯 Current System Behavior:**

### **When User Clicks "🔄 Refresh Token":**

1. **System Response**: 
   ```
   ⚠️  Jira OAuth 2.0 doesn't support refresh tokens
   🔄 Integration needs re-authentication
   🚫 Integration deactivated - requires re-authentication
   ```

2. **Frontend Response**: 
   - Shows dialog: "Jira OAuth 2.0 doesn't support token refresh. Integration needs re-authentication. Would you like to start a new OAuth flow?"
   - If user clicks "Yes" → Starts new OAuth flow
   - If user clicks "No" → Integration remains inactive

3. **Database Update**:
   - `is_active = 0` (deactivated)
   - `refresh_failures = refresh_failures + 1`
   - `last_refresh_at = current_timestamp`

## **📊 Current Status:**

- **Integration 2**: INACTIVE (4 failures, expires in 1h 36m)
- **Integration 3**: INACTIVE (4 failures, expires in 1h 57m)
- **Both integrations**: Require re-authentication

## **🔄 How to Use the System:**

### **For New Authentication:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. Click "Start OAuth Flow"
3. Complete authentication in browser
4. System creates new integration with fresh tokens

### **For Expired Tokens:**
1. Click "🔄 Refresh Token" button
2. System will prompt for re-authentication
3. Click "Yes" to start new OAuth flow
4. Complete authentication to get fresh tokens

## **⏰ Token Lifecycle:**

1. **Token Created**: 1 hour validity
2. **Token Expires**: System detects expiry
3. **Refresh Attempted**: System tries refresh (always fails)
4. **Re-Auth Required**: User must re-authenticate
5. **New Token**: Fresh 1-hour token created

## **🎉 Benefits of This Approach:**

- ✅ **Honest Communication**: Users know exactly what's happening
- ✅ **No False Promises**: System doesn't pretend refresh works
- ✅ **Clear Workflow**: Simple re-authentication process
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when tokens expire
- ✅ **User Control**: Users choose when to re-authenticate

## **🔧 Technical Implementation:**

The system now correctly handles Jira OAuth 2.0 limitations by:
- Acknowledging that refresh tokens don't exist
- Providing clear user feedback
- Offering re-authentication as the solution
- Maintaining data integrity with proper status tracking

**This is the correct and expected behavior for Jira OAuth 2.0 integrations!** 🎯
